# Chapter 2 CUDA Programming Model

## 📌 Highlights
- Exposing a two-level thread hierarchy through the programming model is one of the CUDA's distinguishing features: Grid of thread blocks, threads in thread blocks. This lets you control a parallel environment.
- Grid and block dimensions and their configurations could impact on the kernel performance. Learning how to organize threads is one of the central practices of CUDA programming.
- Grids and blocks represent a logical view of the thread layout for kernel execution. Different perspective in Chapter 3 may be useful: the hardware view.
