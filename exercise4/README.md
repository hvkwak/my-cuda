# Chapter 4 Global Memory

## üìå Highlights
- There are several ways to (dynamically) allocate global memory in the *host* and transfer data to the *device*.
- When transferring the *pageable* host memory, the CUDA driver first allocates temporary *page-locked* or *pinned* host memory, copies the source *pageable* memory to it, and then transfers the data from pinned memory to *device* memory.
- *Pinned* memory is host memory that is locked in physical RAM. Its data transfer between *host* and *device* is faster than *pageable* memory. For example, on Fermi devices, it is advantageous to use *pinned* memory when transferring more than 10MB of data. Note that Too much *pinned* memory leads to less *pageable* memory on host. It can degrade system performance and has slow allocation time.
- *Zero-copy* memory is a type of pinned (non-pageable) memory that is mapped into the device address space. It enables the GPU to directly access the host memory without needing to transfer it to the device memory.
- With *Unified Virtual Addressing*, *host* and *device* memory share a single virtual address space.
- *Unified Memory* is a new feature that simplifies memory management in the CUDA programming model.
- Data transfer from *host* to *device* is expensive and may be a reason for a bottleneck of the overall application performance, if not managed properly. Thereotical peak bandwidth between GPU chip and the on-board GPU memory is very high. The link between CPU and GPU through the PCIe Bus is limited which varies by the architecture.


## üß™ Exercise 4-2
Refer to the file `globalVariable.cu`. Replace the following symbol copy functions:
`cudaMemcpyToSymbol()`
`cudaMemcpyFromSymbol()`

with the data transfer function

`cudaMemcpy()`

You will need to acquire the address of the global variable using
`cudaGetSymbolAddress()`

### üîë Key Ideas
- Basic but key: it's about static global memory!
- `cudaMemcpyToSymbol()` copies data from *host* to global memory in *device*,
- `cudaMemcpyFromSymbol()` copies data from global memory in *device* to *host*. 
- `cudaGetSymbolAddress()` allows direct mapping of an address of a symbol in *device*
- `cudaMemcpy()` can directly copy pageable *host* memory to global memory that a pointer is pointing to.

### üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details
Resetting `valueArray` is added to test it properly.

``` cuda
// (..snipped..)
float valueArray[5] = {3.14f, 3.14f, 3.14f, 3.14f, 3.14f};
CHECK(cudaMemcpyToSymbol(devArray, &valueArray, sizeof(float)*5)); // To symbol "devArray"
for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++){
    printf("Host:   copied %f to the global array \n", valueArray[i]);
}

checkGlobalArray<<<1, 5>>>();

CHECK(cudaMemcpyFromSymbol(&valueArray, devArray, sizeof(float)*5)); // From symbol "devArray"
for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++){
    printf("Host:   the value changed by the kernel to %f\n", valueArray[i]);
    valueArray[i] = 3.14f; // reset
}

// (..snipped..)
float *dptr = NULL; // pointer to the first element of devArray
CHECK(cudaGetSymbolAddress((void **)&dptr, devArray));
CHECK(cudaMemcpy(dptr, &valueArray, sizeof(float)*5, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice));

// (..snipped..)
```



## üß™ Exercise 4-3
Compare performance of the pinned and pageable memory copies in `memTransfer` and `pinMemTransfer` using `nvprof` and different sizes: 2M, 4M, 8M, 16M, 32M, 64M, 128M.

## üß™ Exercise 4-4
Using the same examples, compare the performance of pinned and pageable memory allocation and deallocations using CPU timers and different sizes: 2M, 4M, 8M, 16M, 32M, 64M, 128M.

## üß™ Exercise 4-5
Modify `sumArrayZerocopy.cu` to access A, B, and C at an offset. Compare performance with and without L1 cache enabled. If your GPU does not support conÔ¨Åguring the L1 cache, reason about the expected results.
